##Activity 3: There are 2 types of contexts: Application and Request. An Application context (current_app or  g) provides a place to store data during a request or CLI command. ##Current_app is an instance for an active application and g is an object that the app can use for temporary memory. In contrast, a Request context (request or session) keeps ##track of request-level data during a request. A request object encapsulates contents of an HTTP request sent by the client and session is a dictionary which stores values ##between requests. An Application context is only pushed following a Request context.
